# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the _R Markdown_ thesis template. This template is based on (and in many places copied directly from) the Reed College LaTeX template, but hopefully it will provide a nicer interface for those that have never used TeX or LaTeX before.  Using _R Markdown_ will also allow you to easily keep track of your analyses in **R** chunks of code, with the resulting plots and output included as well.  The hope is this _R Markdown_ template gets you in the habit of doing reproducible research, which benefits you long-term as a researcher, but also will greatly help anyone that is trying to reproduce or build onto your results down the road.

Hopefully, you won't have much of a learning period to go through and you will reap the benefits of a nicely formatted thesis.  The use of LaTeX in combination with _Markdown_ is more consistent than the output of a word processor, much less prone to corruption or crashing, and the resulting file is smaller than a Word file. While you may have never had problems using Word in the past, your thesis is likely going to be about twice as large and complex as anything you've written before, taxing Word's capabilities.  After working with _Markdown_ and **R** together for a few weeks, we are confident this will be your reporting style of choice going forward.

<!-- 
If you're still on the fence about using _R Markdown_, check out the resource
for newbies available at <https://rbasics.netlify.com>. 
-->

**Why use it?**

_R Markdown_ creates a simple and straightforward way to interface with the beauty of LaTeX.  Packages have been written in **R** to work directly with LaTeX to produce nicely formatting tables and paragraphs. In addition to creating a user friendly interface to LaTeX, _R Markdown_ also allows you to read in your data, to analyze it and to visualize it using **R** functions, and also to provide the documentation and commentary on the results of your project.  Further, it allows for **R** results to be passed inline to the commentary of your results.  You'll see more on this later.  

<!-- 
Having your code and commentary all together in one place has a plethora of 
benefits!
-->

**Who should use it?**

Anyone who needs to use data analysis, math, tables, a lot of figures, complex cross-references, or who just cares about the final appearance of their document should use _R Markdown_. Of particular use should be anyone in the sciences, but the user-friendly nature of _Markdown_ and its ability to keep track of and easily include figures, automatically generate a table of contents, index, references, table of figures, etc. should make it of great benefit to nearly anyone writing a thesis project.

# R Markdown Basics {#rmd-basics}

Here is a brief introduction into using _R Markdown_. _Markdown_ is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. _R Markdown_ provides the flexibility of _Markdown_ with the implementation of **R** input and output.  For more details on using _R Markdown_ see <https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.  

Be careful with your spacing in _Markdown_ documents.  While whitespace largely is ignored, it does at times give _Markdown_ signals as to how to proceed. As a habit, try to keep everything left aligned whenever possible, especially as you type a new paragraph. In other words, there is no need to indent basic text in the Rmd document (in fact, it might cause your text to do funny things if you do).

Here is a reference to @angel2000.

# Writing

You can use `R` code in your document. For example:

````markdown
`r ''````{r ch1-load-packages, message=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

```{r ch1-load-packages, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

Naming the code chunks is convenient for navigating your document. You can use chunk options to control what the code does and how it is displayed. See Yihui Xie's documentation about chunk options https://yihui.org/knitr/options/. In the chunk above `message=FALSE` forces the chunk to not display messages when the packages are loaded.

Of course, unless you are explicitly illustrating/discussing the code, you might not want the code to appear in the thesis! As another example, a chunk would _not_ be displayed _at all_ in the output document if `echo=FALSE`.

```{r ch1-load-data, echo=FALSE}
data(mpg)
```

You can create elegant figures and tables using `R` and displaying them in your thesis.

Figure \ref{fig:ch1-scatterplot} is an example of a figure generated using the package `ggplot`.

```{r ch1-scatterplot, echo=FALSE, out.width="0.8\\linewidth", fig.cap="\\label{fig:ch1-scatterplot}Example of a scatterplot"}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

Table \ref{tab:summary-statistics} is an example of a table created using the package `kableExtra`.

```{r ch1-table, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
kableExtra::kable(mpg %>%
                    select(displ, year, cyl) %>%
                    summary(),
                  "latex",
                  booktabs = TRUE,
                  caption = "\\label{tab:summary-statistics}Example of a table with summary statistics")
```

## Math

\TeX\ is the best way to typeset mathematics. Donald Knuth designed \TeX\ when he got frustrated at how long it was taking the typesetters to finish his book, which contained a lot of mathematics.  One nice feature of _R Markdown_ is its ability to read LaTeX code directly.

If you are doing a thesis that will involve lots of math, you will want to read the following section which has been commented out. If you're not going to use math, skip over or delete this next commented section.


<!-- MATH and PHYSICS majors: Uncomment the following section -->
$$
\sum_{j=1}^n (\delta\theta_j)^2 \leq {{\beta_i^2}\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}}
\left[ 2\rho_i^2 + {\delta_i^2\beta_i^2\over{\delta_i^2 + \rho_i^2}} \right] \equiv \omega_i^2
$$

From Informational Dynamics, we have the following (Dave Braden):
<!--

After _n_ such encounters the posterior density for $\theta$ is

$$
\pi(\theta|X_1< y_1,\dots,X_n<y_n) \varpropto \pi(\theta) \prod_{i=1}^n\int_{-\infty}^{y_i}
   \exp\left(-{(x-\theta)^2\over{2\sigma^2}}\right)\ dx
$$

Another equation:

$$
\det\left|\,\begin{matrix}%
c_0&c_1\hfill&c_2\hfill&\ldots&c_n\hfill\cr
c_1&c_2\hfill&c_3\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+1}\hfill\cr
c_2&c_3\hfill&c_4\hfill&\ldots&c_{n+2}\hfill\cr
\,\vdots\hfill&\,\vdots\hfill&
  \,\vdots\hfill&&\,\vdots\hfill\cr
c_n&c_{n+1}\hfill&c_{n+2}\hfill&\ldots&c_{2n}\hfill\cr
\end{matrix}\right|>0

## Physics

Many of the symbols you will need can be found on the math page <https://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex/math.html> and the Comprehensive LaTeX Symbol Guide (<https://mirror.utexas.edu/ctan/info/symbols/comprehensive/symbols-letter.pdf>).

## Biology

You will probably find the resources at <https://www.lecb.ncifcrf.gov/~toms/latex.html> helpful, particularly the links to bsts for various journals. You may also be interested in TeXShade for nucleotide typesetting (<https://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/beitz/txe.html>).  Be sure to read the proceeding chapter on graphics and tables.

# Conclusion {-}

If we don't want Conclusion to have a chapter number next to it, we can add the `{-}` attribute.

**More info**

And here's some other random info: the first paragraph after a chapter title or section head _shouldn't be_ indented, because indents are to tell the reader that you're starting a new paragraph. Since that's obvious after a chapter or section title, proper typesetting doesn't add an indent there.


<!--chapter:end:03-conclusion.Rmd-->

<!--
The bib chunk below must go last in this document according to how R Markdown renders.  More info is at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html
