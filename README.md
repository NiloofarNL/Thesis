# Abstract

Travel can have benefits beyond just reaching a destination, with psychological factors such as enjoyment and relaxation playing an important role. People assign different levels of importance to instrumental (environment, cost, health and fitness, convenience, predictability, flexibility) and affective (relaxation, no stress, excitement, control, freedom) motives depending on their purpose of travel. While some people may use normalization as a coping strategy to adjust to stressful travel conditions, it may impair their quality of life if used in non-life-threatening situations. Individuals differ in their sensitivity and vulnerability to stress, and coping strategies can be problem-focused or emotion-based.This research aims to examine whether normalization/learned helplessness could serve as coping strategies. The study employs a bivariate ordinal model using a set of dependent and independent variables extracted from individual characteristics and health information parts of the surveys. The dependent variables selected for this study are stress indicators, which include the level of stress experienced by respondents while commuting and the importance level of the stress experienced during travel. The independent variables used are respondents' age, income level, occupation, education and their primary mode of transportation during regular commuting. The dataset used in this study was obtained from a paper-based survey conducted face-to-face in Santiago in 2016. The findings of this study have important implications for understanding coping strategies in relation to stress and commuting.
